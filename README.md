Flow - Technical Design Information
Welcome to the repository for "Flow". This README provides insight into the technical design of our project, with a special emphasis on our XRPL integration, which is a cornerstone for our grant submission.

XRPL Integration
Our project integrates seamlessly with the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This integration is at the heart of Flow's functionality, enabling NFT mint and wallet interaction methods.

Code Structure
Our code is organized into distinct regions, each marked at the beginning with /// #regionName.

- Flow Core: The primary logic behind the application.
- XRPL Module: A dedicated module handling all XRPL interactions.
- UI/UX Components: Interfaces that users will engage with.

Notes:

- This repo was specifically created to be shared
- Draw Functions & Audio Generation are currently placeholders.They will be made public after the season drop.
- The repo doesn't include AWS modular architecture which handles remote data and events (es: check that same configuration NFT was not minted by another user, pack/unpack sources, etc)
- Check here for minting sample showcase: https://youtu.be/bdmcaG8pDqM
